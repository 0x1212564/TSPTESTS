# Restaurant Waiter Route Optimization

This project implements and compares different algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in the context of restaurant waiters delivering food to tables. The goal is to find the optimal route for a waiter starting from the kitchen, visiting all tables exactly once, and returning to the kitchen while minimizing the total distance traveled.

## Problem Description

In a restaurant setting, a waiter needs to deliver food from the kitchen to multiple tables in the most efficient way. This is modeled as a TSP where:
- The kitchen is the starting and ending point (vertex 0)
- Each table is a vertex that must be visited exactly once
- The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled

## Features

- Implementation of five different TSP algorithms
- Comprehensive benchmarking system
- Visualization of routes
- Unit tests for algorithm validation
- Restaurant datasets of varying sizes (from 6 to 100 tables)

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Brute Force**: Examines all possible permutations to find the optimal solution (only practical for small instances)
2. **Nearest Neighbor**: A greedy algorithm that always visits the closest unvisited vertex
3. **2-opt Local Search**: Improves an initial solution by swapping edges to reduce total distance
4. **Genetic Algorithm**: Uses evolutionary principles with selection, crossover, and mutation operations
5. **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that uses temperature-based acceptance criteria to escape local optima

## Project Structure

- `tsp_algorithms.py`: Core implementations of all TSP algorithms
- `tsp_main.py`: Main entry point with command-line interface
- `tsp_benchmark.py`: Benchmarking functionality to compare algorithm performance
- `tsp_unit_tests.py`: Comprehensive test suite for all algorithms

## Usage

### Running the Algorithms

```bash
# Run all algorithms on the large restaurant dataset (default)
python tsp_main.py

# Run on a specific restaurant size
python tsp_main.py --restaurant small
python tsp_main.py --restaurant medium
python tsp_main.py --restaurant large
python tsp_main.py --restaurant larger
python tsp_main.py --restaurant mega

# Run without visualization
python tsp_main.py --no-visualize
```

### Running the Benchmark

```bash
python tsp_main.py --benchmark
```

This will run all algorithms on all dataset sizes, measure performance, and generate comparison charts saved as:
- `tsp_benchmark_results.csv`: Raw benchmark data
- `tsp_benchmark_results.png`: Computation time and route quality comparison
- `tsp_growth_rate.png`: Route distance growth by problem size

## Visualization

The project can visualize the routes generated by each algorithm. Visualizations include:
- The complete route with direction arrows
- Kitchen highlighted as a green square
- Tables as red dots
- Total route distance

Visualization files are saved as `route_{size}_{algorithm}.png`.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Distance calculation correctness
- Route validity (starts/ends at kitchen, visits all tables once)
- Algorithm consistency (deterministic algorithms produce the same result)
- Performance bounds (algorithms complete within reasonable time)

Run the tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest tsp_unit_tests.py
```

## Dataset Generation

The project generates synthetic restaurant layouts with tables randomly distributed around a central kitchen:
- Small: 6 tables
- Medium: 12 tables
- Large: 20 tables
- Larger: 50 tables
- Mega: 100 tables

## Performance Considerations

- Brute Force is only practical for very small instances (â‰¤10 tables)
- Nearest Neighbor is very fast but produces suboptimal solutions
- 2-opt Local Search offers a good balance of speed and solution quality
- Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing can find high-quality solutions for large instances

## Dependencies

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling
- Matplotlib: For visualization
- Python 3.6+: For type hints and modern language features
